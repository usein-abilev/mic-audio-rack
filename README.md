# MicAudioRack

**MicAudioRack** is an open-source audio routing application written in modern C++ using the [JUCE](https://juce.com/) framework. It allows users to route microphone input through a customizable chain of audio effects, including both VST3 plugins and built-in processors, and output the processed audio to any available device.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JUCE 7.x (you can clone it from [https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE))
- CMake >= 3.15
- C++17-compatible compiler (MSVC, Clang, or GCC)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone project and JUCE (adjust paths if needed)
git clone https://github.com/usein-abilev/mic-audio-rack.git
cd ./mic-audio-rack

# Set JUCE_DIR in CMakeLists.txt if not already pointing to JUCE
cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --config Debug
```

The resulting executable will be located in `build/MicAudioRack_artefacts/Debug` or similar depending on your platform.
